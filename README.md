# Python Overview

- These are my notes, explanations, code snippets, and examples for Python. The Notes are based on the book "learning Python" by Mark Lutz. I have also added some of my own examples and explanations.
- The notes are divided into different sections. The sections are loosely divided based on the topics covered in the book.
- The notes are written in a way that they can be used as a quick reference guide or a refresher.
- This is a work in progress. I will keep updating the notes as I learn more about Python.
