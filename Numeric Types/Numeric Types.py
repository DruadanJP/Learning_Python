# Integer and float operations
a = 10
b = 3.5

# Exponential operations
print(a ** 2)  # 100

# Square root methods
import math
print(math.sqrt(144))  # 12.0
print(144 ** 0.5)      # 12.0

# Explanation:

# Integers and floats can be used in operations interchangeably.
# Exponents and square roots are handled efficiently.
# Example Output:

# 100
# 12.0
# 12.0
