Pythonâ€™s bool type, with values True and False, is a subclass of int, printing as words instead of digits. While True and False behave like 1 and 0, this customization improves code readability and truth value clarity.


>>> True == 1                
True # Same value

>>> True or False            
True # Same as: 1 or 0

>>> True + 4                 
5

>>> False == 0
